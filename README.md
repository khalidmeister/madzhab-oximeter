# Madzhab Oximeter: An Android-Based Oximeter Application
## Introduction
Madzhab Oximeter is an application for calculating oxygen saturation (SPO2) by using the smartphone's camera. The app records your finger via camera for 5 seconds, and then it calculates the SPO2 based on the red and blue channel from the video. This repository contains the prototype, which is on a jupyter notebook format, and also the application itself that is based on Android (Java). 

## Implementation
This app is implemented using: 
- Android Studio for developing the app,
- Java as the programming language, 
- OpenCV for processing the video, 
- FFmpeg for extracting frames from the video, and 
- JavaCV as the connector to the OpenCV and FFmpeg.
